# TO-do list
Core
○ Node.js with TypeScript
○ Git Version Control via GitHub
○ Jest
○ ESLint
● Backend
○ Amazon Web Services/Azure
○ Relational and Non-Relational Databases
○ Serverless Framework
○ Headless CMSes like Prismic and Sanity
○ Low-Code/No-Code platforms like Xano
● Frontend
○ React Native for mobile apps on iOS and Android
○ React for web
○ Redux


Using the tech stack described above, produce a simple To Do list project (or similar). You are
not expected to use the full stack, but it should be written in TypeScript and include the
following:
1. CRUD API written in TypeScript that can be deployed via Serverless to AWS
2. React Native mobile app that interacts with your CRUD API, and utilizes Redux state
management
We should be able to view your project in a GitHub repository/repositories and be able to deploy
and run your code. Please include any instructions for us to do this in a README.md
## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router
- React Icons
- React Redux
- TypeScript
- UUID
- Redux Persist
- Jest (for testing)
- Testing Library (Jest-Dom, React, User-Event)
- Web Vitals

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:



## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
